    <h1>3 Star - Exercise</h1>
    <p>Your sketch:</p>
    <div class="guidance">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Continuing to build on the exercises so far, your task is to add visual and animated elements to your classes in order to create 
                an interactive scene. Here are some recommendations (feel free to deviate from these):
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each animal should have an image, like last practical. You may decide whether this should be passed in 
                    through the constructor or whether each child class should always use the same image.
                </li>
                <li>Each type of animal should move in a way that is appropriate. To take full advantage of polymorphism, you can use a single function name that is 
                    common to all subclasses (e.g. move() rather than walk() or fly()). Alternatively, you can choose method names that are more appropriate 
                    to the way animals of a specific subclass move. Just make sure you don't have flying cats and dogs, unless that is a deliberate design choice.
                </li>
                <li>Show each animal's call in the sketch (e.g. by adding a speech bubble, or playing a sound).</li>
                <li>Add more animals to the hierarchy e.g. snake, whale, elephant, tiger. How can you build upon and extend 
                    the existing classes?
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <button class="btn btn-primary hint" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#hint" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="hint">
                Hint
            </button>
            <div class="collapse" id="hint">
                <div class="card card-body">
                    <p>For clues on how to add images, revisit last practical (or the solution code).</p>
                    <p>When adding new attributes and methods to a class hierarchy, the key to good OOP is to always add new 
                        elements at the highest point in the hierarchy that makes sense. For example, as all classes in the hierarchy 
                        should have an image, it would make sense to add this component to the <code>Animal</code> class. That way, 
                        you don't have to repeat the code across multiple classes.
                    </p>
