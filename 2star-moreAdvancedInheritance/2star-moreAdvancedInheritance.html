        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <div>
            <p>This exercise is short, but it requires you to think a bit more carefully about how to implement the requirements. This exercise builds on the 1 star exercise, so begin by copying your code from that exercise into 
                the sketch file for this exercise.
            </p>
            <p>Add a new subclass of <code>Bird</code> called <code>Parrot</code>. Some parrots mimic sounds they hear. The <code>Parrot</code> class should store a collection 
                of phrases that the parrot can say. When a parrot is first created, it should know one phrase, "Squawk!". You will write code that enables a parrot to learn 
                more phrases. To implement this, the <code>Parrot</code> needs a new method, <code>mimic()</code>, which takes one argument, an animal. When 
                this method is called, add the animal's call to the parrot's collection of phrases.
            </p>
            <p>Override the <code>call()</code> method in <code>Parrot</code>. Instead of returning the same phrase each time, randomly select one of its learned phrases to return. For 
            example, if a parrot has learned to mimic a cat and a dog named Spot, its <code>call()</code> method will randomly return 
        one of the following: "Squawk!", "meow", "Hello, my name is Spot".</p>
            <p>There is no check file or expected output for this exercise, so you will need to work out how to test it yourself.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <button class="btn btn-primary hint" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#hint" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="hint">
                Hint
            </button>
            <div class="collapse" id="hint">
                <div class="card card-body">
                    <p>The first step to implementing the expected functionality, is to decide what sort of collection you will use to 
                        store the learned phrases. When the <code>mimic()</code> method is called, you can use the <code>call()</code> method of the 
                        <code>mimic()</code> method argument to "learn" the animal's call by adding it to the collection.
                    </p>
                    <p>Selecting a random phrase to return for the <code>Parrot</code>'s <code>call()</code> method will be 
                    easier if you have stored the phrases as an array of strings. In that case, you can generate a random integer corresponding 
                to an index in the array. If you're not sure how to do this, there has been an example already in the module. However, your should try to 
            figure it out on your own first. You have all the knowledge you need!</p>
                    <p>You should test your methods by creating some example animals (of all child classes), including a parrot or two, and calling 
                        the <code>mimic()</code> and <code>call()</code> methods. Due to the random nature of the overridden <code>call()</code> method, you will 
                    need to call it multiple times to make sure it is choosing different phrases.</p>
