        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <div>
            <p>We are continuing the animal theme today. You will be creating a 
                hierarchy of classes to represent different animals as shown in the diagram 
                below. This exercise will not have any visual output—you 
                will need to check your code using the browser console.</p>
            <p>sketch.js contains a different version of an <code>Animal</code> class, and a 
                child class, <code>FurryAnimal</code>. Take a moment to 
                read the code. Familiarise yourself with the class attributes and methods in both 
                classes as you will need these when implementing more inheriting classes.
            </p>
            <h3>Task 1: <code>Bird</code></h3>
            <p>Add a new subclass (another term for a child class) of <code>Animal</code> called <code>Bird</code>, which has 
            an additional private attribute <code>#beakType</code> (string). Add a getter for <code>#beakType</code> called <code>getBeakType()</code>. 
            The parent class has a method called <code>decreaseHealth()</code>, which reduces the animal's health level 
        by 1. Override this method in the <code>Bird</code> class. The <code>Bird</code> version of <code>decreaseHealth()</code> should 
    reduce the health level by a larger amount (e.g. 5).</p>
            <h3>Task 2: Extending <code>FurryAnimal</code></h3>
            <p>Add two new classes called <code>Cat</code> and <code>Dog</code>. Both classes should be 
            subclasses of <code>FurryAnimal</code>. These classes do not have any new attributes but they 
        will need some new methods.</p>
            <p>In the <code>Cat</code> class:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Add a new method called <code>jumpAt()</code>, which takes one parameter, a bird. In this method, the cat should jump at the bird by moving to its location, which should cause the bird's health to decrease.</li>
                <li>Override the <code>call()</code> method so that it simply returns "meow" for cats.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the <code>Dog</code> class, add a new method called <code>barkAt()</code>, which takes one parameter, a cat. If the cat is too close to the dog (you can decide how close is too close), print "Woof!" or something similar to the console.</p>
            <h3>Task 3: Test your code</h3>
            <p>A check file is provided for this exercise. It will make sure your code matches the specification above. However, it's always good to try out your code yourself. Try creating instances of 
                each class in the <code>setup()</code> function provided and test them by calling methods and printing the results to the console. There are two 
                examples of this in the code already.

                    <p>You should not need to make any changes to the existing classes!</p>
                    <p>It is a good idea to have the example code from lecture on hand as all tasks are very similar 
                        to the examples covered in lecture.
                    </p>
                    <p>To implement the <code>Bird</code> method <code>decreaseHealth()</code>, you need to change the value of the attribute <code>#healthLevel</code>. As this 
                    attribute is private to the parent class and therefore cannot be accessed directly in <code>Bird</code>, consider how you can 
                call the super class (parent class) version of the <code>decreaseHealth()</code> method to achieve the desired result.</p>
                    <p>You may find the p5.js <code>dist()</code> function helpful when implementing the <code>Dog</code> method <code>barkAt()</code>.</p>
